## Challenges & Lessons Learned

"The primary challenge was designing and implementing a seamless multi-step ordering process within the Android activity lifecycle. 
This involved managing the state of a user's order as they navigated between the menu, item customisation, and final order screens. 
I learned to use Intent objects to effectively pass data between activities, ensuring a smooth and logical user experience from product selection to checkout."
